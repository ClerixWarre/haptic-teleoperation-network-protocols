## Protocol Characteristics

### QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)
- **Strengths**:
  - Lowest latency for real-time control
  - Built-in encryption and security
  - Connection migration support
  - Excellent congestion control
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Higher CPU usage
  - Newer protocol with less widespread support
- **Best For**: Haptic feedback, surgical robotics, time-critical control

### DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)
- **Strengths**:
  - Lightweight protocol
  - Low overhead
  - Simple implementation
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Poor reliability (13.4% loss)
  - Limited congestion control
  - No built-in security
- **Best For**: Non-critical telemetry, status updates

### SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
- **Strengths**:
  - Multi-streaming support
  - Path redundancy (multi-homing)
  - Excellent reliability
  - Message boundaries preserved
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Higher latency
  - Complex implementation
  - Limited NAT traversal
- **Best For**: Industrial automation, reliable command delivery

## Recommendations by Use Case

### Surgical Robotics
**Recommended: QUIC**
- Sub-millisecond latency critical
- High reliability required
- Security built-in

### Industrial Automation
**Recommended: SCTP**
- Reliability more important than latency
- Multi-path redundancy valuable
- Established protocol support

### Telemetry and Monitoring
**Recommended: DCCP or UDP**
- Low overhead important
- Some packet loss acceptable
- Simple implementation

### Remote Vehicle Control
**Recommended: QUIC**
- Low latency for responsive control
- Handles network changes well
- Good for mobile/wireless scenarios

## Statistical Significance

ANOVA testing confirmed statistically significant differences between protocols (p < 0.001) for:
- Latency measurements
- Jitter values
- Packet delivery rates

## Conclusion

QUIC emerges as the optimal choice for haptic teleoperation requiring sub-millisecond precision, while SCTP serves applications prioritizing reliability over latency. DCCP's poor reliability limits its use to non-critical applications.
